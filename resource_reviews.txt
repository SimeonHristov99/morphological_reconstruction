    Morphological Image Analysis, Principles and Applications
        What did the authors try to accomplish?
            This is a book about image preprocessing. The authors tried to outline the current state of the field.
        What were the key elements of the approach?
            The examples are very well explained.
            Also, the fact that there are a lot of examples and applications.
        What can you use yourself?
            By far the most useful resource. A lot of text has been taken for the theory part.

    Understanding Morphological Image Processing and Its Operations
        What did the authors try to accomplish?
            This article is a very good introduction to the two most widely used morphological operations.
            Talks about erosion, dilation, closing, opening, and edge detection.
        What were the key elements of the approach?
            It explains clearly when the value is 1 and 0 when using either erosion or dilation by introducing the process of fit, hit, and miss. I haven't seen them used before.
        What can you use yourself?
            Can be used in a presentation on the topic in the introduction part.
        What other references do you want to follow?
            It has a reference to this: [1] P Soille. “Morphological Image Analysis, Principles and Applications”, 1999. Could the part with applications help? Yes, just checked - chapter 6: Geodesic Transformations has sections for morphological reconstruction. Definitely will review in the future. Maybe there will be an inspiring application in chapter 12 so will review it as well.

    Intro to Morphological Reconstruction
        What did the authors try to accomplish?
            Present in a clear and concise manner what this operations entails.
        What were the key elements of the approach?
            Lots of very useful examples.
            No Maths.
        What can you use yourself?
            It turns out that morphological reconstruction is actually another type of morphological operations. I thought it was something like an application of them / an algorithm.
            This operation builds on top of dilation.
            Can be used in a presentation as a general structure to follow.
            Can be used in a presentation when giving examples.
        What other references do you want to follow?
            The last part (at the very bottom) is called "Applications of Morphological Reconstruction" and could be used for the second part of the project, but also the theorical part (where applications are discussed).

    Morphological Grayscale Reconstruction in Image Analysis: Applications and Efficient Algorithms
        What did the authors try to accomplish?
            Give definitions for the elementary operations making up morphological reconstruction, present applications, and list algorithms for implementing it.
        What were the key elements of the approach?
            Helpful pictures are presented.
            Several definitions are given for the same concept.
        What can you use yourself?
            I found it interesting that different definitions for the same concept are given - they can be used for the theory part as well as a more in-depth understanding of the concepts.

    How To Make Geodesic Dilation And Erosion In Morphology
        What did the authors try to accomplish?
            Short and to-the-point article that describes what geodesic dilation and erosion are. It provides nice visuals and pictures.
        What were the key elements of the approach?
            The pictures are very intuitive.
            It also refers to the same terminology that is used in the books and other articles which is very good.
        What can you use yourself?
            The pictures can be used as a testing suite for the elementary geodesic dilation and erosion.
            The code can be used if having problems with the implementation.

    Morphological Reconstruction
        What did the authors try to accomplish?
            Describe what the process entails and give examples of applications and algorithms.
        What were the key elements of the approach?
            In a short and concise manner explain what the term means / the goal of the process is and give an example.
        What can you use yourself?
            It talks about H-Dome Extraction, Downhill Filter, and Hybrid Algorithm. These are applications and knowing them might be useful.
            In the first paragraph they have a bullet list with applications. In my opinion, they are not very practical, but could serve as an inspiration and be further researched.

    Efficient Morphological Reconstruction: A Downhill Filter
        What did the authors try to accomplish?
            Introduce a very fast algorithm for performing morphological reconstruction - the downhill filter.
            They also list and compare it with four more algorithms.
        What were the key elements of the approach?
            Use of a random access queue. A consequence of this is data insensitivity.
        What can you use yourself?
            This paper relates more to the topic of "efficient algorithms for morphological reconstruction" and thus can be considered a subtopic which should not be in my focus.
