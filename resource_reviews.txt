Understanding Morphological Image Processing and Its Operations
    What did the authors try to accomplish?
        This article is a very good introduction to the two most widely used morphological operations.
        Talks about erosion, dialation, closing, opening, and edge detection.
    What were the key elements of the approach?
        It explains clearly when the value is 1 and 0 when using either erosion or dialation by introducing the process of fit, hit, and miss. I haven't seen them used before.
    What can you use yourself?
        Can be used in a presentation on the topic in the introduction part.
    What other references do you want to follow?
        It has a reference to this: [1] P Soille. “Morphological Image Analysis, Principles and Applications”, 1999. Could the part with applications help? Yes, just checked - chapter 6: Geodesic Transformations has sections for morphological reconstruction. Definitely will review in the future. Maybe there will be an inspiring application in chapter 12 so will review it as well.
