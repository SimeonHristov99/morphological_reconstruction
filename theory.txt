Morphological reconstruction by dilation is similar to basic morphological dilation: high-intensity values will replace nearby low-intensity values. The basic dilation operator, however, uses a footprint to determine how far a value in the input image can spread. In contrast, reconstruction uses two images: a “seed” image, which specifies the values that spread, and a “mask” image, which gives the maximum allowed value at each pixel. The mask image, like the footprint, limits the spread of high-intensity values. Reconstruction by erosion is simply the inverse: low-intensity values spread from the seed image and are limited by the mask image, which represents the minimum allowed value.

Alternatively, you can think of reconstruction as a way to isolate the connected regions of an image. For dilation, reconstruction connects regions marked by local maxima in the seed image: neighboring pixels less-than-or-equal-to those seeds are connected to the seeded region. Local maxima with values larger than the seed image will get truncated to the seed value.









The first application deals with extracting objects from a binary image.

np_img = np.array(uploaded['Screenshot from 2022-12-27 14-46-20.png'])





The second application deals with the interpolation of contour line images. By contour line image, we mean an image where intensity values are known only along closed contour lines. An image of elevation contour lines is shown in Fig. 6.31: each line has a constant grey scale value corresponding to the terrain elevation along the line and the elevation values of the pixels belonging to white regions in between two successive contour lines are unknown. In this example, contour lines are associated with terrain elevation values but they could represent other spatial-dependent characteristics of an object. For instance, one could transform a grey tone image into an image of iso-intensity contour lines and then attempt to regenerate the original image (i.e., lossy image compression technique). There is therefore a need for interpolating values located in between successive contour lines. Geodesic transformations are at the basis of an efficient method taking advantage of the topological and morphological properties of th e contour lines (Soill e, 1991).

The method requires two steps:
    1. generation of two plateau images;
    2. interpolation along the steepest slope lines.
The first step illustrates well the use of morphological reconstruction techniques. It consists in finding for each white pixel the elevation of both contour lines surrounding the white region it belongs to. A magnified section of an image of contour lines is presented in Fig. 6.32a. The pixel p lies within a white region surrounded by two contour lines referred to as its lower and upper contour lines. The lower contour line of a pixel p is denoted by C1(p) and the upper one by Cu(p). These two contour lines may be identical as shown in Fig. 6.32b or when p is located precisely on a contour line.
